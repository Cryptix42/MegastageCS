MegastageCS
===========

A control system for Megastage ships created by me, Cryptix, for a game called "Megastage" created by Orlof.
Megastage is a "homebrew" project based on Notch's 0x10c, it will involve customizable ships, a large explorable 
universe, and a 16-bit computer from the late 1980's called the "dcpu-16". This control system (CS) is not a 
full OS (yet) for the dcpu-16, but a simple set of asm code and drivers that give the dcpu-16 and it's user the control 
over the ship's systems needed to pilot the ship through the megastage universe.
