DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: 8k-UWTM
    (8 kilobyte per second Universal Wireless Transceiver Modem)
    Version: 87
    ID: 0xddf14760
    Manufacturer: 0xE142A1FA (Ender Innovations)

Description:
    This device is a mixture of a standard FSK radio transmitter/receiver array and an internet modem patented by Ender Innovations.
    Each modem contains a unique 16-bit ip address in which to identify by, a 512 word max packet size, a maximum
    range of 10,000,000 meters, and a 256 packet buffer.

Interrupt behavior:

A - Behavior

0 - POLL_DEVICE Sets B and C to state and error codes, respectively.

	Status codes:
	0x0: stand-by
	0x1: sending packet
	0x2: clearing buffer
	0x3: transceiver unpowered
	
	Error codes:
	0x0: nominal
	0x1: packet target no longer in range
	0x2: packet buffer overflow
	0x3: transceiver powered off
	0x4: received corrupted packet
	0xF: hardware malfunction

1 - SEND_PACKET 
	Takes a packet from RAM starting at B with length C and sends it to the ip in I.

2 - RECEIVE_PACKET 
	Takes the next packet from the buffer and writes it to an area of RAM starting at B.
	Sets C to the size of the packet in words, and I to the origin ip of the packet.
	Halts the dcpu-16 for number of cycles equal to the length of the packet.

3 - CLEAR_BUFFER
	Clears the packet buffer of all stored packets. Modem waits till transmission operations are done and takes 64 milliseconds
	to clear the buffer during which time incoming packets and interrupts are ignored. 
	WARNING: This process deletes all packets!

4 - SET_POWER Sets the transmission power to B KW with a maximum of 1000 KW, the range of the transmitter is proportional to the power.
	The range of the transmitter is 10km per kilowatt. If B = 0 then the transceiver will be turned off.
	
5 - SEARCH_IP Returns a list of all available ips within set range to RAM starting at B. 
	If the number of ips exceeds 512, then only the 512 nearest will be stored.

6 - SET_INTERRUPT Sets interrupts with message B, if B = 0 then interrupts are disabled. 
	An interrupt fires every time an error generates, the status changes, or a packet is received into buffer.
