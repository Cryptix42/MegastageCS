DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: HTA 90 (Hybrid Tracking Array)
    Version: 90
    ID: 0x3442980F
    Manufacturer: 0xE142A1FA (Ender innov.)

Description:
    This is a mixup of a standard radar detection array and a laser targeting
    theodolite built by Ender innovations because we believe we are better at
    building tracking systems (and anything for that matter) than anyone else
    and not because of our inflated ego either (we consider that to be a
    separate and unrelated issue).

    This tracking system is built to scan for targets whether they be manmade
    or natural and easily target and scan any one of them to get information
    as easily as can be done with our obviously superior technology.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by radar, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    0 - STORE_SIGNATURES
        Copies echo signatures received with last radar sweep from internal
        memory to 16 word area of DCPU ram starting at B. Maximum of 16 nearest
        objects are copied. Each signature is a unique 16-bit number that is
        never equal to 0. If the are less than 16 signatures then rest of
        signature array is filled with 0.

    1 - SET_TRACKING_TARGET
        Sets the tracking target to the object with the signature in B.

    2 - STORE_TARGET_DATA
        Sets a 7 word area of ram starting at B to radar data of target.

        Word 1 = type of object ( 0=unknown 1=natural 2=manmade).
        Words 2 and 3 = [INT32] est. mass of object in kilograms (roughly
            approximated from density and size readings. NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE!).
            If both words 2 and 3 equal 0, then mass calculation cannot be
            accurately ascertained.
        Words 4 and 5 = [FLOAT] distance in meters between ship and target.
        Words 6 and 7 = the pitch and yaw angles between the direction of the
            target and the direction that the ship is pointing.

    3 - GET_VECTOR
        Sets a 12 word area of ram starting at B to [ORBITAL_STATE_VECTOR]
        of target in _ship's_ SOI.
