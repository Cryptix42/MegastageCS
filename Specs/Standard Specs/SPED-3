A Behavior:

0 Poll device. Sets B to the current state (see below) and C to the last error
   since the last device poll.
   States:
   0x0000 STATE_NO_DATA No vertices queued up, device is in stand-by
   0x0001 STATE_RUNNING The device is projecting lines
   0x0002 STATE_TURNING The device is projecting lines and turning
   Errors:
   0x0000 ERROR_NONE There's been no error since the last poll.
   0xffff ERROR_BROKEN There's been some major software or hardware problem, try turning off and turning on the device again.
   
1 Map region. Sets the memory map offset to X, and the total number of vertices

Each vertex occupies two words of information in the main DCPU RAM. The data is
encoded as (in LSB-0 format):
 First word: YYYYYYYYXXXXXXXX
Second word: 00000ICCZZZZZZZZ
Where XXXXXXXX is the X-coordinate of the vertex, YYYYYYYY is the Y-coordinate,
ZZZZZZZZ is the Z-coordinate, CC is color, and I is intensity.
Z is deeper into the screen, if the device is placed face up on the ground, this
translates to "up" relative to the user.
Possible color values are 0: black, 1: red, 2: green, 3: blue.
If the intensity bit is set, the color is drawn as more intense.
The black color is meant to barely be visible at all, except for in very dim
environments, or if the intensity bit is set.
