Manufacturer: 0x1c6c8b36 (NYA_ELEKTRISKA)
Description:
    The LEM1802 is a 128x96 pixel color display compatible with the DCPU-16.
    The display is made up of 32x12 16 bit cells. Each cell displays one
    monochrome 4x8 pixel character out of 128 available. Each cell has its own
    foreground and background color out of a palette of 16 colors.

A Behavior

0: MEM_MAP_SCREEN
       Reads the B register, and maps the video ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of video ram.
       If B is 0, the screen is disconnected.
       When the screen goes from 0 to any other value, the the LEM1802 takes
       about one second to start up. Other interrupts sent during this time
       are still processed.
1: MEM_MAP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and maps the font ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of font ram.
       If B is 0, the default font is used instead.
2: MEM_MAP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and maps the palette ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of palette ram.
       If B is 0, the default palette is used instead.
3: SET_BORDER_COLOR
       Reads the B register, and sets the border color to palette index B&0xF
4: MEM_DUMP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and writes the default font data to DCPU-16 ram
       starting at address B.
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 256 cycles
5: MEM_DUMP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and writes the default palette data to DCPU-16
       ram starting at address B.
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 16 cycles
