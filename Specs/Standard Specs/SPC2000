A Behavior

0: GET_STATUS
       Sets the C register to 1 if the SPC2000 is ready to trigger. If it's not,
       the B register is set to one of the following values:
          0x0000: ######################## - EVACUATE VESSEL IMMEDIATELY
          0x0001: Not in a vacuum
          0x0002: Not enough fuel
          0x0003: Inhomogeneous gravitational field
          0x0004: Too much angular momentum
          0x0005: One or more cell doors are open
          0x0006: Mechanical error
          0xffff: Unknown error - EVACUATE VESSEL IMMEDIATELY
1: SET_UNIT_TO_SKIP
       Reads the B register, and reads a 64 bit number from memory address B
       in big endian, and sets the number of units to skip to that number.
2: TRIGGER_DEVICE
       Performs GET_STATUS, and if C is 1, triggers the SCP2000. The status can
       be read as the result of the GET_STATUS call.
3: SET_SKIP_UNIT
       Reads the B register, and sets the size of the unit to skip to one of:
           0x0000: Milliseconds
           0x0001: Minutes
           0x0002: Days
           0x0003: Years
