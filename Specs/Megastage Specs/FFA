DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Far Field Acceleresolutor (Gravitation sensor)
    Version: 0x6673
    ID: 0x3846bc64
    Manufacturer: 0xb8badde8 (Otec)

Description:
    The gravity sensor is used to detect and resolve local gravity fields.
    Otec's Far Field Acceleresolutor 6673 can analyse up to 16 strongest
    gravity sources with maximum detection range of 214.748.364 to
    303.700.048 km.

Interrupt behavior:

    When a HWI is received by the Acceleresolutor, it reads the A register and
    does one of the following actions:
    
    0: STORE_FIELD_SIGNATURES
        Copies gravity field signatures from Acceleresolutors internal memory
        to 16 word area of DCPU ram starting at B.

        Each signature is a 16-bit value that is never equal to 0. If less than
        16 gravity wells were resolved on latest gravity sweep, end of the
        signature list is filled with 0.

        Strongest gravity field's signature is stored in index 0 and rest of the
        fields are listed in the order of decreasing field strengths.

        Halts DCPU for 16 cycles.

    1: STORE_ORBITAL_STATE_VECTOR
        Stores Orbital State Vector to 12 word area of ram starting at C.
        Reference frame's field signature is given in B.

        Halts DCPU for 12 cycles.

    2: STORE_FIELD_DATA
        Stores Gravity Field Data to 4 word area of ram starting at C.
        Reference frame's field signature is given in B.

        Halts DCPU for 4 cycles.

    3: GET_SOI_FIELD_SIGNATURE
        Return current SOI's field signature in B.



Orbital State Vector:
    The binary format for defining an orbital state vector is:
        word 0 - 1: INT32 ship's x coordinate in reference frame (unit 100m)
        word 2 - 3: INT32 ship's y coordinate in reference frame (unit 100m)
        word 4 - 5: INT32 ship's z coordinate in reference frame (unit 100m)
        word 6 - 7: INT32 ship's x velocity in reference frame (unit m/s)
        word 8 - 9: INT32 ship's y velocity in reference frame (unit m/s)
        word 10 -11: INT32 ship's z velocity in reference frame (unit m/s)


Gravity Field Data:
    The binary format for defining a Gravity Field Data is:
        word 0-1: FLOAT standard gravitational parameter Î¼ of SOI (unit kg)
        word 2-3: ANGLE The pitch and yaw angles between the SOI and the
                        direction the ship is pointing.

    
Floating Point Number (FLOAT):
    The binary format for defining a floating point value is:

    word 0: seeeeeee eeeeeeee
    word 1: ffffffff ffffffff
    
    Sign bit determines the sign of the number, which is the sign of the
    significand as well. (0: positive, 1: negative)

    Exponent is 15 bit unsigned integer from 0 to 32767. Stored value is
    offset from the actual value by 0x8000 bias.

    Fraction is 16 bit unsigned integer from 0 to 65535.

    Following values are interpreted specially:
        0x0000 0x0000: +0
        0x8000 0x0000: -0
        0x7FFF 0x0000: +Inf
        0xFFFF 0x0000: -Inf
        0xFFFF 0xFFFF: NaN
