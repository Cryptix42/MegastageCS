DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: XL Control Moment Gyroscope (gyroscope)
    ID: 0xeec6c4de
    Version: 0xabcd
    Manufacturer: 0xe1e0bd31 (GENERAL DRIVES)

Description:
    Ships use electrically-powered reaction wheels, also called momentum wheels,
    to control attitude and achieve stabilization. Massive wheels are typically
    mounted in three orthogonal axes aboard the spacecraft. They provide means
    to trade angular momentum back and forth between spacecraft and wheels. To
    rotate the vehicle in one direction, you spin up the proper wheel in the
    opposite direction. To rotate the vehicle back, you slow down the wheel.

    General Drive's high capacity Control Moment Gyroscope provides highly
    sophisticated control interface that hides the low level spin speed
    momentum management and automatic momentum desaturation manouvers.

    Ships computer can simply set the level of torque that will be generated
    by gyroscope around its axis of installation.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the XLCMG, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    0: SET_TORQUE_LEVEL
       Reads the B register and sets the CMG to generate torque. Amount of
       generated torque depends on B that is interpreted as two's complement
       signed number.
       
       Total torque = 50kNm * B / 0x7fff

       If B is 0 or insufficient power is available, gyroscope will stabilize
       the ship in respect to it's installation axis.

       When sufficient power is restored torque generation will continue at
       specified power level.

       Disclaimer: Setting torque to 0x8000 is not allowed and may seriously
       damage or destroy the CMG. General Drives cannot be held liable
       under any circumstances by anyone, directly or indirectly, in any
       specific or other way, for damages resulting from the use 0x8000.

    1: GET_STATUS
       CMG's current status is set to B register and torque power level to C
       register.

    2: SET_ROTATION_AXIS
       Gyroscope's rotation axis vector is set to B register. Vector has the
       format: 0000xxxxyyyyzzzz

       Each of the cartesian components are in two's complement format.
