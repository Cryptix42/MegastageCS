DCPU-16 Hardware Info:

    Name: Force Field
    ID: 0xF1E7D666, version: 0x0911
    Manufacturer: 0xa3783fc8 (Cradle Tech)




Description:
    Minimum size for field is r=5m
    Field must contain 50 MWs / m2 of surface area
    After field collapse 30s particle cleanup period is required before restart.
    Shield evaporates energy at the rate of 0.5 % / s.
    
Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the Enter name here, it reads the A register and
    does one of the following actions:
    
    0: GET_STATUS

    Sets the B register to force shield status

    0x0000 Device was shut down or never started
    0x0001 Field formation in progress
    0x0002 Field active

    1: GET_FIELD_RADIUS

    Sets the B register to force field radius (m)

    2: GET_FIELD_ENERGY

    Sets the registers B:C to energy stored in field (MWs)

    3: SET_ENERGY_INTAKE

    Sets the power intake to B (MW)



NOTE: possible tinkering variables (mean):
